There are many great tutorials out there to understand and learn Go. I think Go is a fantastic language and an extremely powerful one when you're looking for something that excels at concurrency and keeping it cheap and extremely easy to do. 

There are so many more reasons why one would want to give Go a chance, but I'm sure you can easily look it up instead of reading it here :)

Here's what I did in the project as an overview:
* It's a simple CLI application that does not have any complexities. I just didn't want to waste time and at the same time, actually touch on most topics required to understand Go.
* This simple project was iterated constantly, cleaned up and then pushed. I did not just put it all down.
* Topics implemented - `DATA TYPES` `VARIABLES & CONSTANTS` `FORMATTED OUTPUT` `USER INPUT` `POINTERS` `SCOPE RULES` `LOOPS` `IF-ELSE & SWITCH` `FUNCTIONS` `PACKAGES` `GOROUTINES` :smile:

I would like to thank `TechWorld with Nana` for the project idea and just really explaining everything so well. While this is a tutorial-driven project, I've really understood it all by doing. Not by watching and taking credit for the work.
